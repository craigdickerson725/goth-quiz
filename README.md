*Welcome to A Goth Quiz To Make You Sad!  The goal of this quiz is to give goths and non-goths alike a silly quiz to test your knowledge of goth culture.  The correct answers within the questions aren't exactly informative in and of themselves, but rather the names and songs in the answer options are intended to introduce names of people, albums, and songs that are important to the goth scene as we know it.  So put on your black lipstick and your best skull rings, and dive headfirst into this fun goth quiz!

## UX

The design process was quite simple, actually.  The goal was to create a game with a well-known 'quiz-show' format to give those goth kids out there something to do in the spare time they have between sleeping all day and dancing badly in burned-out goth clubs late at night.  The goal was to display the name of the game above the question area.  The question area itself holds the bulk of the content, and almost all of the interactive features.
